Hi! I am an undergraduate student pursuing a B.S. degree in Applied Mathematics and Data Science (concentration in Artificial Intelligence) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) and [New York University Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/). Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant at [Stanford University Department of Management Science & Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/), mentored by Prof. [Ye Yinyu](https://profiles.stanford.edu/yinyu-ye). My current research interest is second-order optimization in Operation Research, but I am also generally interested in applying computational mathematics techniques to solving practical problems such as resource allocation, global health, risk reductions etc.

Feel free to reach out to me through email if you are interested in my projects, research area, or others!
